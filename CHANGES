# 0.1.6 - hertogp

- options resolved in this order (using gle and im_fmt as an example):
    + by codeblock attributes     {.gle im_fmt="svg"}
    + by klass specific metadata  imagine.gle.im_fm: svg
    + by imagine metadata         imagine.gle.im_fmt: svg
    + by imagine code             im_fmt = 'png' (on Handler parent class)

- added options:
    + `im_dir` to set path to store input/output files
    + `im_log` to set level of verbosity during processing

- removed output format limitations/checks (mostly)
    + `im_fmt` is whatever you want it to be, beware.
    + now, its possible to whatever output format a cli-tool produces

- broke large sample.md into examples per utility
    + allows for easier testing
    + see examples/Makefile
    + could not test octave due to bug in libosmesa6
    + pyxplot was not tested
      (not an apt-get pkg under bionic, manual install is required)


# 0.1.5 - hertogp

- renamed options to `im_<xxx>` to reduce possibility for namespace conflicts:
    + `im_out=fcb,stdout,stderr,image`  specify what to output in which order
    + `im_opt="cli options"`            add these options on the command line
    + `im_prg=cli-command`              use this command (no derive by class)

- reduce footprint of filter
    + by default pandoc-imagine now removes all of its own classes
    + all other classes are retained when outputting an image or codeblock

- fixed some pylint warnings (len(sequence) for example...)

# 0.1.4 - hertogp

- `pay_the_pypir.awk` to fix README.rst for PYPI
    + fix .. code:: by removing any 'roles' which PYPI doesnt seem to like
    + make urls for images on github absolute

# 0.1.3 - hertogp

# 0.1.2 - hertogp

Still fiddlin' with PYPI
